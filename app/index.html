          <!-- Discover Phase -->
          <h3>Discover: Primary & Secondary Research</h3>
          <p>
            The process began with secondary research to identify potential
            problem areas, followed by primary research including qualitative
            observations, ethnographic studies, and interviews in Sydney.
            Quantitative surveys were conducted to gauge public knowledge and
            habits during high-heat seasons.

          <!-- Define Phase -->
          <h3>Define: Thematic Analysis</h3>
          <p>
            The primary research was synthesized into key themes, revealing
            issues like the relation of heat to wealth, lack of public
            awareness, and the scarcity of free, cool spaces.

          <h3>Develop: Ideation & Prototyping</h3>
          <p>
            Storyboards were used in the ideation process, and affinity
            diagramming and thematic analysis helped identify root issues for
            the prototype. Six iterations were conducted, each refining the core
            features and interface based on feedback.

            High-fidelity prototypes were developed and tested, leading to
            significant enhancements based on user feedback. The final design
            was developed into a web application, incorporating different APIs
            for an interactive user experience.
