          <h3>Challenge</h3>
          <p>
            Addressing the Urban Heat Island effect to improve urban
            habitability and climate resilience in Sydney.
          </p>

          <h3>Goal</h3>
          <p>
            These findings align with the priorities of the United Nations‚Äô
            Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, specifically target 11.b,
            which advocates for the mitigation of and adaptation to climate
            change impacts in urban areas. (Movement and Place - NSW Government,
            2023)<br /><br />
            The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 further
            mandates the importance of understanding and strengthening
            resilience against environmental hazards like heat waves, often
            labeled as 'silent disasters.' (ArcGIS StoryMaps, 2021)
          </p>

          <h3>Process Overview</h3>
          <p>
            Adopted the double-diamond approach encompassing discovery,
            definition, development, and delivery phases, enriched with
            iterative design and constant user feedback.

          <h3>Key Findings</h3>
          <p>
            Uncovered a critical connection between UHI effects and
            socio-economic factors, emphasizing the need for widespread
            awareness and user-centric solutions.
          </p>

          <h3>Prototype and User Testing</h3>
          <p>
            Conducted multiple rounds of prototyping and user testing to refine
            the web application.

          <h3>Outcome</h3>
          <p>
            Developed a responsive web application that leverages real-time body
            temperature, location and weather for proactive heat mitigation
            suggestions through AI Chat and maps.
